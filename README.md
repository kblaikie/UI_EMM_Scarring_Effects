# UI_EMM_Scarring_Effects
This repository hosts analytic scripts for an ongoing project examining whether unemployment insurance policies ameliorate the harmful effects of becoming unemployed on future employment quality.

To examine this question, we use longitudinal participant data from the 2001-2019 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), and the TWFE estimator developed by Imai, Kim, and Wang in their 2018 AJPS article "Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Time-Series Cross-Sectional Data".
